# pnut-child

`pnut-child` is the child-runtime crate for `pnut`: the `#![no_std]` executor
that runs after `clone3()` and before `execve()`.

## Why this crate exists

After `clone3`/`fork`, the child process inherits a copy of the parent's
address space — including any locked mutexes held by threads that no longer
exist. Calling `malloc`, `std::env`, or any function that takes a lock will
deadlock. This is fine when the parent is single-threaded (like the `pnut`
CLI), but breaks for library users embedding `pnut` in multi-threaded
programs (tokio, rayon, etc.).

`pnut-child` enforces the correct execution model:

- `#![no_std]`, no `alloc` — zero heap allocation after fork
- raw syscalls only — no libc functions that aren't async-signal-safe
- data-driven — consumes a pre-built `ChildSpec`, doesn't reach back into
  parent data structures

## Public API

The public interface is intentionally narrow:

- `run(&mut ChildSpec<'_>) -> !` — the executor entry point
- `ChildSpec<'a>` and subsystem spec types — the data contract
- `ChildFailure` and `Stage` — the fatal failure protocol
- `CompletionSink` — an optional prevalidated, fixed-binding completion
  evidence destination

Everything else (fd helpers, mount syscall wrappers, env assembly, Landlock
execution) is internal implementation detail.

## Failure reporting

On setup failure, `pnut-child` writes a fixed-size 16-byte `ChildFailure`
record to `status_fd`:

```
[version: u16 | stage: u16 | errno: i32 | detail: i32 | exit_code: i32]
```

The parent decodes this into a structured `Error::ChildSetup` with the
failing stage, errno, and a human-readable message. On successful `execve`,
the `CLOEXEC` flag closes the write end automatically — the parent reads
0 bytes (no failure).

When `status_fd` is `None` (execve mode), `pnut-child` writes stage-specific
error messages directly to stderr.

## Completion evidence

When `ChildSpec::completion` is present, `run` requires mount/pivot,
rlimits, capabilities, descriptor closure, `NO_NEW_PRIVS`, and seccomp to be
configured and to finish successfully. It then writes and closes exactly one
42-byte record immediately before `execve`:

```
[version: u16 LE | tag: "PCMP" | binding: [u8; 32] | complete_stage_mask: u32 LE]
```

`CompletionRecord::decode(bytes, expected_binding)` accepts only that exact
framing, version, tag, runtime-owned mask, and expected binding. The binding
and evidence FD are the only caller-supplied parts of `CompletionSink`;
callers cannot provide a status, stage bits, or payload. The FD is retained
through descriptor closure and may not alias the status or sync FD or be
altered by an FD action. Pipe type, child-write access, and CLOEXEC remain
explicit parent-side prevalidation responsibilities.

Completion evidence only proves the child reached the `execve` boundary. A
consumer must accept it only alongside a clean CLOEXEC close of the separate
status FD and no `ChildFailure`; an `execve` failure follows the record with a
fatal status record.

## Crate properties

- `#![no_std]` with only `libc` as a dependency
- no heap allocation anywhere
- all operations are async-signal-safe
- safe for use after fork in multi-threaded processes
